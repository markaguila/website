2 player dice game created using Python.

Goal: Players take turns rolling 1 to 10 dice. The sum of the dice is added to their score. The first player to reach 100 points wins.
Pig Out: If any of the dice rolls a 1, the player's score is 1 for the turn.
Free Bacon: A player can roll no dice and instead score points equal to the absolute value of the difference of the digits of the opponent's score.
Swine Swap: After a player's turn is over, if one of the player's scores is a multiple of the other's, their scores are swapped.
